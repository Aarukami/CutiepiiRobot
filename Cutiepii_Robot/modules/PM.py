Emilia import/export settings feature allows you to quickly set up a chat using a preexisting template. Instead of setting the same settings over and over again in different chats, you can use this feature to copy the general configuration across groups.
The generated file is in standard JSON format, so if there are any settings you dont want to import to your other chats, just open the file and edit it before importing.
Exporting settings can be done by any administrator, but for security reasons, importing can only be done by the group creator.
The following modules will have their data exported:
- admin
- antiflood
- blacklists
- disabled
- filters
- greetings
- locks
- notes
- pins
- reports
- rules
- warns
Chat owner commands:
- /export: Generate a file containing all your chat data.
- /import: Import the settings in the replied to data file.
Examples:
- To export chat data:
-> /export

 ‚Ä¢ `{fullname}`: this represents the user's full name. Defaults to first name if user has no last name.

 ‚Ä¢ `{count}`: this represents the user's member number.
 ‚Ä¢ `{chatname}`: this represents the current chat name.
Each variable MUST be surrounded by `{}` to be replaced.
Welcome messages also support markdown, so you can make any elements bold/italic/code/links. Buttons are also supported, so you can make your welcomes look awesome with some nice intro buttons.
To create a button linking to your rules, use this: [Rules](buttonurl://t.me/ShokoGbot?start=group_id).

To avoid slowing down, Shoko caches admin rights for each user. This cache lasts about 10 minutes; this may change in the future. This means that if you promote a user manually (without using the /promote command), Shoko will only find out ~10 minutes later.
If you are getting a message saying:
You must be this chat administrator to perform this action!
This has nothing to do with Shoko's rights; this is all about YOUR permissions as an admin. Shoko respects admin permissions; if you do not have the Ban Users permission as a telegram admin, you won't be able to ban users with Shoko. Similarly, to change Shoko settings, you need to have the Change group info permission.

Do stickers annoy you? or want to avoid people sharing links? or pictures? You're in the right place!
The locks module allows you to lock away some common items in the telegram world; the bot will automatically delete them!

Locks can be used to restrict a group's users.
eg:
Locking urls will auto-delete all messages with urls, locking stickers will restrict all non-admin users from sending stickers, etc.
Locking bots will stop non-admins from adding bots to the chat.
**Note*":
